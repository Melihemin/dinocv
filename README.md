# Dinocv

This application allows us to detect the objects in the dinosaur game and move our dinosaur accordingly.
We used keras-retinanet as a model in the application.
Although we could not achieve a very high success result due to the small number of data, our "LOSS" value was quite low.
In the next version I will upload files for the control of the dinosaur.
